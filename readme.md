# Multi-Step Form Project

## Project Overview

This project involves building a multi-step form with a focus on usability, design fidelity, and responsiveness. It's an excellent opportunity to practice and showcase your front-end development skills, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any frameworks or libraries you're interested in.

### Objectives

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence.
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections.
- View a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order.
- View the optimal layout for their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

Additionally, the form should provide validation feedback when:

- A field is missed.
- The email address is not formatted correctly.
- A step is submitted without a selection.
